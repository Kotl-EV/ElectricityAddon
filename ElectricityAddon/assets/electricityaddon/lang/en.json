  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricityaddon-text": "<strong>Description</strong><br>The mod adds electricity, electrical appliances, devices, weapons, and armor to the game. All of this helps to make (or not) survival in the game world easier, reduce the amount of routine, and diversify the gameplay experience.<br><br><strong>Basics</strong><br>The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy only transforms from one form to another or from one body to another. So it is in the game.<br><br>The main source of mechanical energy is windmills. Generators can be used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. To do this, you need to use a shaft and/or gear to transfer the torque from the windmill to the generator shaft. After that, the generator will start generating electricity.<br><br>Electrical energy can be transmitted through cables to consumers. Simply place the cable on the blocks in the desired direction. Up to 4 cables can be placed on each face of the block, which will be directed in different directions. This allows you to lay cables in any direction and branch the electrical circuit. The cable must be connected to the iron plate of the electrical appliance, then it will start its work. Electrical appliances and metal blocks can also be conductors of electricity.<br><br>Since the wind does not always blow and not at full strength, the energy output of generators may not be enough to power all electrical appliances. To avoid this, you need to connect your electrical circuit to the accumulator(-s). They will constantly accumulate electrical energy and give it to the circuit to power the devices, at any time, even in the absence of wind.<br><br>To save energy, some devices need to be disconnected from the circuit when not in use. The switch is used for this. Install it on the section of the circuit where you need to disconnect the power.<br><br>For some devices, where mechanical energy is still needed for operation, an engine will be needed. It converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It needs to be connected to the device with a shaft. When turned on, the engine will try to deliver maximum power to the shaft, so make sure that there is enough energy in the circuit.",

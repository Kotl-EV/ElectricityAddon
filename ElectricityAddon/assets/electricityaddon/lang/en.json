  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricityaddon-text": "<strong>Electricity: ElectricityAddon/Electricity modification</strong><br>The modification adds electrical energy, electrical appliances, devices, weapons and armor to the game. All this helps to make it easier (or not) Survive in the game world, reduce the amount of routine, as well as a diverse gaming experience.<br><br><strong>Basics</strong><br>The law of conservation of energy states that energy does not arise from nowhere and does not disappear anywhere. Energy only passes from one type to another or from one body to another. So it is in the game.<br><br>The main source of mechanical energy is windmills. Generators can be used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. To do this, you need to transfer the torque from the mill to the generator shaft using a shaft and/or gear. After that, the generator will start generating electricity.<br><br>Electrical energy can be transmitted via cables to consumers. Simply place the cable blocks in the desired direction. Up to 4 cables can be placed on each side of the unit, which will be directed in different directions. This allows you to lay cables in any direction and branch the electrical circuit. The cable must be connected to the iron plate of the electrical appliance, then it will start its work. Electrical appliances and metal blocks can also be current conductors.<br><br>Since the wind does not always blow and is not at full strength, the power generation by generators may not be enough to operate all electrical appliances. To avoid this, it is necessary to connect your electrical circuit to the battery(s). They will constantly accumulate electrical energy and supply it to the circuit to power the devices, at any moment, even in the absence of wind.<br><br>To save energy, some appliances need to be disconnected from the circuit when not in use. A switch is used for this. Install it in the area of the circuit where you need to turn off the power.<br><br>For some devices where mechanical energy is still needed for operation, an engine will be needed. It converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. You need to connect it with a shaft to the device. When turned on, the motor will tend to produce maximum power on the shaft, so make sure that there is enough power in the circuit.",

  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricityaddon-rotors-title": "Electricity: Motors and generators",
  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricityaddon-rotors-text": "<strong>Electricity: motors and generators</strong><br>The modified motors and generators allow converting electrical energy into mechanical energy and vice versa. To do this, you need to connect cables to them and connect them with a shaft. <br><br><strong>Game mechanics features</strong><br>Motors and generators most closely simulate the behavior of such devices from real life. DC machines were used as an example. Therefore, in order to better understand how to use them and in what situations, you need to understand the laws by which they work. <br>All rotating mechanisms in the game, including shafts and gears, have two basic parameters: torque (<i>torque</i>) and moment of resistance (<i>resistance</i>). The torque characterizes the force with which the mechanism rotates the shaft, and the moment of resistance characterizes the friction forces and losses that may occur during their operation. The torque of the shafts and gears is zero. The game engine adds up all the moments and calculates the speed of the shaft (<i>speed</i>) and its acceleration/deceleration. If the torque is greater than the moment of resistance, then the speed of the shaft will increase. If the opposite is true, it will decrease. At the same time, both of these parameters change according to certain laws. Usually, the moment of resistance increases with increasing speed.<br><br><strong>Generators</strong><br>In the modification, the generators have the following additional parameters: <br><i>I_max</i> – the maximum value of energy generation; <br><i>speed_max</i> – the maximum nominal rotation speed; <br><i>resistance_factor</i> – multiplier for the moment of resistance; <br><i>resistance_load</i> is the constant component of the moment of resistance. <br><br>The power generation by the generator depends only on the speed on the shaft and is calculated using the formula: <br><i>power = I_max *(1 – (|speed| / speed_max – 1) ^4 ) </i>.<br>That is, energy production from zero increases rapidly and smoothly reaches its maximum value. If the <i>speed_max value is exceeded</i>, the output is <i>power = I_max</i>. <br>At the same time, the moment of resistance first increases linearly from <i>resistance_load</i>, and when speed_max is exceeded, it increases according to a quadratic dependence. <br><i>if |speed| &lt;= speed_max  then   resistance = resistance_load + (resistance_factor * |speed|/ speed_max) </i> <br> <i>if |speed| > speed_max then resistance = resistance_load + (resistance_factor * (|speed|/ speed_max)^ 2) </i><br><br><strong>Engines</strong><br>In the modification, the generators have the following additional parameters: <br><i>I_min</i> – the minimum energy required for the engine to start working; <br><i>I_max</i> – the maximum energy consumption; <br><i>torque_max</i> – maximum torque; <br><i>kpd_max</i> – peak efficiency;<br><i>speed_max</i> – maximum rated rotation speed; <br><i>resistance_factor</i> – multiplier for the moment of resistance. <br><br>The engine produces torque directly proportional to the energy available to it. At the same time, the engine also takes into account its own consumption efficiency curve depending on the torque. The efficiency reaches its maximum at 70% of <i>torque_max</i>. The efficiency curve from zero grows first along a parabola (quadratic dependence, when the branches of the parabola are down) to the top at <i>kpd_max</i>, and then gradually drops to 90% of <i>kpd_max</i> at a torque <i>torque_max</i>.<br><br>The moment of resistance of the motor is calculated similarly to the generator, only <i>resistance_load</i> is zero.",
